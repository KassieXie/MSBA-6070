# MSBA-6070
 Including class assignments and other course related work
 
# CA4 - Ensemble Models

**Goal:** Try different emsemble methods on the same dataset(census dataset) and compare their performance. 


Dataset: 

The dataset is obtained from the Census Bureau and represents salaries of people along with seven demographic variables. 

The following is a description of our dataset:

â€¢ Number of target classes: 2 ('>50K' and '<=50K') [ Labels: 1, 0 ]

â€¢ Number of attributes (Columns): 7

â€¢ Number of instances (Rows): 48,842

You should be able to obtained the dataset in the folder.

## Assignment Requirements

1. Building a Random Forest Model
2. Building AdaBoost, Gradient Boost (classifier) and XGB Model
3. Compare Performance

## Language 

The programming language: Python 3

The file format: ipynb 
- Any application that can open .ipynb file will be great, but I highly recommend using Google Colab or Ananconda Jupyter Notebook.

The comment and text language: English 

## Packages Installed 
Python packages: 
all sorts of packages including numpy, sklearn, and so on.

- The codes include installing packages are already embeded in this notebook. It shouldn't have problem if you run my code step by step. 

## Expected Outcome
The expected outcome should already be displayed in the notebook under the codes, but feel free to test the code on your own.

## Logic Behind
The sklearn.ensemble module includes ensemble-based methods for classification, regression and anomaly detection.

All formal sources related to ensemble methods provided by scikit-learn developers can be found at: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html?highlight=sklearn%20ensemble#module-sklearn.ensemble
