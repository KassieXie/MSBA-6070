# CA2 - Decision Tree Algorithm 

Goal: Perform decision tree and a sort of related activities on a dataset

Dataset: 
The dataset is obtained from the Census Bureau and represents salaries of people
along with seven demographic variables. The following is a description of our dataset:
• Number of target classes: 2 ('>50K' and '<=50K') [ Labels: 1, 0 ]
• Number of attributes (Columns): 7
• Number of instances (Rows): 48,842

There are training.csv and testing.csv separated from the original dataset placed in the folder as well.

## Assignment Requirements

1. Data Quality Analysis (DQA) 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Build Decision Tree Classifier Models
4. Visualize Your Decision Tree using GraphViz
5. Evaluate Decision Tree Performance
6. Tune Decision Tree Performance
7. Automation of Performance Tuning -INCOMPLETE
8. Prediction using your “trained” Decision Tree Model -INCOMPLETE

## Language 

The programming language: Python 3

The file format: ipynb 
- Any application that can open .ipynb file will be great, but I highly recommend using Google Colab or Ananconda Jupyter Notebook.

The comment and text language: English 

## Packages Installed 
Python packages: 
all sorts of packages including numpy, sklearn, and so on.

- The codes include installing packages are already embeded in this notebook. It shouldn't have problem if you run my code step by step. 

## Expected Outcome
The expected outcome should already be displayed in the notebook under the codes, but feel free to test the code on your own.

## Logic Behind
Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.

And all other sources related to DTs provided by scikit-learn developers can be found at: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree-algorithms-id3-c4-5-c5-0-and-cart
